                I was born and raised in Brooklyn, New York, a vibrant, colorful place where there was no shortage of culture, creativity, and characters.  After majoring in Psychology and minoring in Theater at Binghamton University, I decided that connecting with and learning about people was what made me feel most ALIVE.

                I attended Brooklyn Collegeâ€™s School Psychology graduate program and practiced as a psychologist, primarily working with adolescents in the Brooklyn High Schools, for several years.  During this time, I discovered that acting helped me be of better service to others.  It was my therapy- I took numerous acting classes and performed regularly with a theater company.  Performing was always about uncovering new layers of myself and about the impact I could have on others.

            In 2005, my husband and I moved to Los Angeles for what was supposed to be a brief adventure, but we started thriving in our careers and loved the weather, so we decided to stay.  In 2009, I had the idea to combine my passions for creativity and helping others and LG Management was born (coincidentally my daughter was also born that year).
